#### Description:

Implemented using the UI5 [manifest.json schema](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-manifest/blob/master/schema.json).

## Installation

### From the VS Code Marketplace

In the [UI5 Language Assistant](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.vscode-ui5-language-assistant) VS Code marketplace page, click **Install**.

### From GitHub Releases

1. Go to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/sap/ui5-language-assistant/releases).
2. Search for the `.vsix` archive under `ui5-language-assist\@x.y.z` releases. (Replace `x.y.z` with the desired version number.)
3. Follow the instructions for installing an extension from a `.vsix` file in the [VSCode's guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery#_install-from-a-vsix).

### Usage

This extension's features are automatically enabled when opening/editing relevant SAPUI5 source files.
For SAPUI5 XML views, this means:`*.view.xml` or `*.fragment.xml` files.

Note that the extension **lazily** downloads the SAPUI5 metadata needed for its features.
This means that there may be a delay between starting VS Code and having the relevant features available.

### Limitations

#### UI5 version and framework

This extension derives the UI5 version in the following sequence:

1. the minUI5Version from the manifest.json file
2. Lookup in CDN for UI5 version and negotiates to the closest LTS version, if not found
3. Default back to 1.71 (latest patch level)

The framework(SAPUI5/OpenUI5) is derived from the ui5.yaml file. This defaults to SAPUI5.

#### Custom controls

This extension does not currently support custom controls, some features, such as validations,
may use heuristics to guess that a tag is a custom control. However, no auto-complete is currently offered
for custom controls.
