# LSP for `manifest.json` file incase of offline mode

To get complete LSP support for `manifest.json` file incase of offline mode, content of [schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP/ui5-manifest/master/schema.json) _MUST_ be downloaded and saved in `manifest>schema.json` file. Furthermore, its content _MUST_ be scan to identify any `http(s)` references. In case any reference is found, its content _MUST_ be downloaded and saved in `manifest><any-reference>.json` and its reference _MUST_ be replaced by `"/manifest/<any-reference>.json"` in `manifest>schema.json`. Currently there is only one such case e.g `"https://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json#/definitions/AdaptiveCard"` for which `adaptive-card.json` file is created and its content is downloaded and paste in that file. Moreover its reference in `manifest>schema.json` is replaced by `"/manifest/adaptive-card.json"`
